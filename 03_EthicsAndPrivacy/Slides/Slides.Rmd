# Research ethics

- **Beneficence and No harm principle:** The purpose of research is to discover new information that would be helpful to society. The purpose of research should never be to hurt anyone or find out information at the expense of other people.

- Researchers often seek to evaluate benefits and harms of their research to indicate that **benefits greatly outweigh potential harms**.

- **Institutional Review Boards (IRB)** for ethics: University processes to safeguard ethical principles in academic research. Scientists submit research designs and the board reviews them and makes a statement about whether the design respects the ethics regulations of the university.

# Ethics of social media research

Beyond the No harm principle:
 - Respecting privacy expectations of **data subjects**: Data are people
 - Downstream consequences of technological development
 - Right to information in the digital society
 
There is no *magic rule* or *solution* in research ethics: Every research design has to be evaluated in detail and its risks and benefits considered carefully

How to do that is evolving over time, building on examples that expose research ethics issues. Here we are going to see a few that have shaped current research ethics in the analysis of social media data and other digital traces

# Preventing harm: Informed consent
.pull-left[
![](figures/InformedConsent.png)
]

.pull-right[

- A way to verify that harm is reduced is to check that research subjects consent to participate in the experiment
- Gathering that consent in an informed way can be challenging
  - Long forms with jargon
  - Unconscious participants
  - Non-invasive or in vivo research

# A note on "ethics approval"

.center[![](figures/IRB.png)]

- IRB only provide statements that a research project design complies with the regulations of the institution regarding human subjects research
- IRB are not "ethics approvals" or "ethics certificates", but they are proof that researchers have followed certain due process to consider ethics issues
- IRB focus on direct harm in experiments (e.g. health adverse effects) and do not consider other downstream social or technical risks

- Examples of identifiers: IP addresses, full names, phone numbers, addresses
- Requirement to get data subject consent for processing and for **sharing with other legal entities** (e.g. through an API)
- The GDPR has numerous exceptions that apply to social media data analysis:
  - When data are manifestly made public by the data subject (Art 9.2e)
  - When processing does not require identification (Art 11)
  - For purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research (Art 5.1b and Art 89)

# Privacy Risks in Online Platforms

**Informational self-determination:** The protection of the individual against unlimited collection, storage, use and disclosure of their personal data, the right for the individual to determine the use of their personal data (habeas data).

One approach: Individualized solutions to privacy risks:
> ”Providing users with transparency and control over their information, leading to an individually controlled balance between the promises and perils of the Digital Age.” *(Kosinski et al, 2013)*

## The Problem of Shadow Profiles

**Facebook Shadow Profile:**  
A file that Facebook keeps on you containing data it pulls from looking at the information that your friends voluntarily provide. [*(Digital Trends, 2013)*](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/)

- 2011: Europe-vs-Facebook files complaint on shadow profiles

- 2013: Bug reveals private information of 6 million users

- Some users notice their shadow profiles with mobile numbers

- Apr 2014: 1B users of Facebook for mobile share  contact lists

- Aug 2016: Whatsapp and Facebook share information

Not a problem unique to Facebook: also in Twitter, Google, Amazon...

## Auditing Shadow Profiles

**Shadow profile hypothesis:**
The data shared by the users of an online platform predicts of personal information of non-users

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=600, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/shadowidea.png")
```
**Approach:** historical audit to evaluate how social networking sites could have predicted information of individuals who were not users yet

- Data represents a bidirectional social network
- Joined date of users shows network growth
- Tweet metadata contains posting app: disclosing users are only those who post at least once from Twitter mobile apps (shared contact lists)
- Predicting location of users who didn't join yet based on disclosing friends already on Twitter

## Summary: Ethics and privacy in SMDA

- Weigh benefit and risk before deciding to start research

- Public data is not automatically fair game: data are people

- Privacy is not binary: Is my research in the interest of the data subjects?

- Ethical data sharing: do share research data, but carefully

- Informed consent is not ticking a box. Do debriefing

- Consider downstream consequences: how can my science be misused?

- Society has a right to information: critically consider Terms of Service
