# Evaluation as final projects

- **Course grading mode is changed to project-based evaluation**

- Grade is still 40% exercises, 60% project work

- Project grade is solely based on final project report

- **Project concept: Illustrating what you have learned during the course**
  - No need to cover all methods in the course, but at least some
  - Need to reflect on how project relates to content of the lectures: theories, limitations, examples from research, etc
  - Methodological standards comparable to the course, e.g. bootstrapping, permutation tests, visualization quality, etc
  

---

# Three project paths

- A) **Replicating a previous paper**
  - Starting from a research article, collect your own dataset to address the same research question
  - No need to cover the full paper - consider course size


- B) **Reproducing a previous paper**
  - Starting from the data shared by the authors of a paper, code your analysis
  - More analysis expected than on replication path


- C) **Proposing your own idea**
  - Be careful about data availability, formulation of research questions, measurement validity...
  - A more exciting path but also one that can be harder

None of these paths has a higher expected grade, they are all equally valid.

---
# Project report structure

1. **Motivation:** What question(s) do you seek to answer and why?

2. **Background:** Who has worked on this before? How does this project relate to the content covered in the lectures and tutorials?

3. **Data:** Describe the data and any resources used to collect it. Explain how you filtered data, normalized values, computed additional variables, etc.

4. **Methods:** Detail the data analysis and statistical methods. Justify your choice.

5. **Results:** Show the results of statistical analyses and visualizations that assess the question(s).

6. **Discussion:** Evaluate answers to the question and their reliability. Assess limitations and critique. Relate to results from other work or replicated paper


---

# Papers to reproduce or replicate

# Recommendations and FAQ

- Start looking at papers to reproduce/replicate soon to assess if data is available or if you can collect your own

- Contact us soon if you need help accessing the Twitter API, the Perspective API, Pushshift dumps, LIWC dictionaries, or other resources. Not everything will be available and you should check soon!

- If you use a statistical method not covered by the course, explain it in the report and **make sure you understand it**

- We will not impose a non-duplicate project topic rule but try to find your own project topic and show me what **you** have learned

- **Questions?**

# Basics of social networks

## 3. The friendship paradox

# Social networks
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="MorenoNetwork.png" alt="Jacob Moreno network." width=450px/&gt;  
&lt;/br&gt;
Jacob Moreno's sociogram
&lt;/div&gt;

Social Networks are models to represent individuals and the relationships between them. The minimal components of a social network are:  

- **Nodes** (or vertices), which represent individuals. These individuals are social actors, for example humans, animals, fictional characters...
- **Links** (or edges) are relationships between individuals, for example friendship, family ties, interaction, communication...

---

# Representing social networks
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkDirected.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;
A graph or network is a tuple `\(G = (V, E)\)`  
  - V is a set of vertices or nodes  
  - E ⊆ V × V is a set of edges or links  
  - V × V is the Cartesian product (i.e. the set of all possible links)  

Edges are denoted as ordered pairs `\((i, j)\)`, which means that a link points from node `\(i\)` to node `\(j\)`. 

The example of the picture can be written as:  
`\(V = {a, b, c, d, e}\)`  
`\(E = {(b, a),(c, a),(e, a),(d, e),(c, b),(b, c)}\)`

---

# Adjacency matrix
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkDirected.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

The above list is what is called an *edge list*, but there are other ways to represent a network. A common one is to use an **adjacency matrix** `\(\mathbf{A}\)` with 1 in the entries of nodes connected by an edge and 0 otherwise. 

|a|b|c|d|e
--|--|--|--|--
a|0|0|0|0|0
b|1|0|1|0|0
c|1|1|0|0|0
d|0|0|0|0|1
e|1|0|0|0|0
---

# Undirected networks
&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkUndirected.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

Networks might be **undirected** if a link between two nodes is always reciprocal.  

Their adjacency matrices satisfy the condition `\(A_{ij}=A_{ji}\)`. 

An example of an undirected network is the network of friendships on Facebook.

---

# Mulit-edge networks

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkPhonecalls.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

In a **multi-edge network**, multiple links are allowed from one node to another. Multi-edge networks can be both directed and undirected. 

The adjacency matrix of multi-edge networks is not well-defined, as each entry of the matrix would have to contain more than just a number.

A common example is a network of phone calls between people, where edges can be differentiated by the timestamp when the call was initiated. 

---

# Weighted networks

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkWeighted.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

The nodes of a network can have weights associated to them, then we talk about a **weighted network**. 

The weighting function `\(w\)` maps links to weights:  `\(w:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)`. 

Weighted networks can be represented by adjacency matrices with real values in their entries that correspond to the link weights: `\(A_{ij}= w(i, j)\)`.
 
---

# Paths and cycles

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="pathsExample.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

One of the most important concepts in a network is that of a **path**. A path is defined as a sequence of nodes, where any pair of consecutive nodes is connected by a link.

A **cycle** is a path starting and ending in the same node. A **triangle** is a cycle of length 3, in the example the nodes `\(a\)`, `\(b\)` and `\(c\)` form a triangle.

---

# Self-loops

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkSelfLoops.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

Some networks might contain **self-loops**, which are links that start and end in the same node, i.e. they have the form `\((i,i)\)`. 

Self-loops appear as ones in the diagonal of the adjacency matrix. 

Self-loops are rare in social networks. They can appear in some communication networks, for example when a Twitter user retweets their own tweet or sends an email to themselves.
---

# Connected components

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkConnectedComponents.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

A network is **connected** if, for each pair of nodes in the network, there is at least one path connecting them. 

If a network is not connected, it can be divided in **connected components**, which are maximally connected subgraphs. The example is not a connected network, as it has two connected components.

---

# Distance

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkUndirected.png" alt="Social network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

The **distance** between nodes `\(v\)` and `\(w\)` is denoted as `\(dist(v,w)\)` and measures the minimum length among all the paths connecting `\(v\)` and `\(w\)`. 

If there is no path between `\(v\)` and `\(w\)`, the distance between them is defined as `\(dist(v,w) := \infty\)`. 

Example: `\(dist(b, e) = 2\)` 

In directed networks, it might happen that `\(dist(v,w) \neq dist(w,v)\)`. 

**proximity:** `\(prox(v,w)=\frac{1}{dist(v,w)}\)`. 

---

# Node degree

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="networkDirected.png" alt="Network example." width=400px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

A node's **degree centrality** measures the number of links connected to it. 

In directed networks:
- **in-degree** `\(d_{in}(i)\)` that is the number of edges ending in `\(i\)`, i.e. `\((j,i)\)` 
- **out-degree** `\(d_{out}(i)\)` that is the number of edges leaving from `\(i\)`, i.e. `\((i,j)\)`

`\(d_{in}(c) = 1\)` and `\(d_{out}(c) = 2\)`

If importance on Twitter is the number of followers of an account, in-degree centrality is a way to measure it.

# Friendship and social comparison

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
&lt;img src="friendshipHighSchool.png" alt="class size paradox." width=600px/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

- **five** girls have fewer friends than the average of their friends (Betty, Jane, Pam, Dale, Tina), two have more friends  
- **two** have more friends than the average of their friends (Sue and Alice)  
- **one** has as many friends as the average of her friends (Carol)  

Most girls will think that they have less friends than the norm! If we average all numbers, the average number of friends is **2.5** and the average number of friends of friends is **2.99**.
